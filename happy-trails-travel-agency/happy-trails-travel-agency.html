    <h1>HAPPY TRAILS TRAVEL AGENCY</h1>
    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>We serve as general sales agents for foreign travel companies, allowing them to have offices in countries other than where their headquarters are located.Our main function is to act as an agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. Consequently, unlike other retail businesses, we do not keep a stock in hand, unless we have pre-booked hotel rooms and/or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or a group event. A package holiday or a ticket is not purchased from a supplier unless a customer requests that purchase.</p>
